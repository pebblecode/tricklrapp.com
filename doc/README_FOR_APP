  rails s
  
## Testing

For testing, the following is used:

* [Rspec](http://rspec.info/)
* [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) - acceptance testing with html interaction
* [Spork](https://github.com/timcharper/spork) - preloads rails env to run tests faster
* [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - automatically runs tests

See [railscast spork](http://railscasts.com/episodes/285-spork) on how to initially set it up spork and guard. 
**Note: All the necessary files should already be set up in the git repo.**

To set up the test environment:

  rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test

To automate tests running in the background:

  guard

To focus guard tests to just run a particular test, use the :focus tag in specs eg,

  it 'renders the index template', :focus do
    response.should render_template("index")
  end

To run tests manually:
  
  # Run the spork server:
  spork
  
  # In another terminal, run the tests
  rspec . --drb
  rspec ./spec/controllers/statuses_controller_spec.rb --drb     # to run individual tests
