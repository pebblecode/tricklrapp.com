# Tricklr

Tricklr is a simple to use web app for marketing teams and high volume tweeters. Tricklr helps you effectively manage your Twitter feed by trickling out tweets at regular intervals. 

## Running the site

  gem install bundle
  bundle install
  rails s
  
## Testing

Rspec and capybara are used for testing. 

For supporting the testing framework, guard and spork (makes tests run faster) are also used.
See [railscast spork](http://railscasts.com/episodes/285-spork) on how to set it up.

To set up the test environment:

  rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test

To run tests:
  
  # Run the spork server:
  spork
  
  # In another terminal
  rspec . --drb
